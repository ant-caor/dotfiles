# Dot Files

This repository contains scripts and configuration files (dot files) for setting up and maintaining my development environment. These dot files are designed to automate the installation and configuration of software and system settings, ensuring a consistent setup across different machines or after a system restore.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure you have administrative access on your machine and that Homebrew is installed. Homebrew will be used to install most of the necessary software.
